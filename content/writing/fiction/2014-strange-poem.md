description: A strange little poem.
---
Everyone is born to be a part of something yellow.  
Like drops of sunlight in the air.  
But is there a sun for people to come from?  
Or are we just a different form...  
Of those who come from somewhere hollow?  
We’ll never leave what we have gained,  
Portraits of feelings we have saved.  
And when there’s seconds left,  
Only music will remain.
